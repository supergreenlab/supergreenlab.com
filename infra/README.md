# SuperGreenCloud

Collection of pre-configured softwares to run the [SuperGreenOS's](https://github.com/supergreenlab/SuperGreenOS) cloud.

![ScreenShot](assets/screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

## Features

- Everything in a `docker-compose.yml` for easy deployement
- [MQTT](https://mosquitto.org/) sink port to receive all logs from the driver
- Minimal log [post-processor](https://github.com/supergreenlab/SuperGreenLog) to redirect to:
  - [Redis](https://redis.io/): stores all last values of each keys sent through the logs
  - [Promethes](https://prometheus.io/): stores all numeric values as timeseries for monitoring and alerts
  - [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) (COMMENTED OUT): indexation and data analysis engine, indexes all logs for further analysis, haven't used it yet.
- [Prometheus' alertManager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/): Allows to describe alert conditions from prometheus timeseries. Then produces alerts on various bias, slack, sms, pigeon, whatnot..
- cAdvisor/node-exporter: The server running the cloud's own monitoring.
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/): Produce nice graphs and dashboard from Prometheus timeseries.
- [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) (COMMENTED OUT): Produce nice graphs and dashboard from Elasticsearch timeseries.
- Update http server for Over-The-Air (OTA) updates for the SuperGreenOS.

## TODO

- Better way to upload the new builds' firmware update files

# Quickstart

Only requirement in a working docker installation:

- [Docker for linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker for mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
- [Docker for windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)

## Configuration

There's not much to configure:

- mqtt login/pass: search for `mqtt_username` and `mqtt_password` in docker-compose.
- domain names used: search for `VIRTUAL_HOST` in docker-compose
- http access passwords in `nginx/htpasswd/`

## Installation

Now that docker is installed and running, clone this repo, and from the repo's directory run the command `docker-compose up`

```js

git clone git@github.com:supergreenlab/SuperGreenCloud.git
cd SuperGreenCloud
docker-compose up

```

When ran locally you might want to have the ports of each services accessible directly, just uncomment the `ports` sections in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Attach firmware

In your firmware intance, set the `BROKER_URL` value through the [http API](https://github.com/supergreenlab/SuperGreenOSBoilerplate#http-access) to point to your installation, be sure to have configured the [wifi access](https://github.com/supergreenlab/SuperGreenOSBoilerplate#wifi-configuration).

Should be somehting like `mqtt://sink.supergreenlab.com:1883`. (If running locally, use your IP address, whatever the domain you set in `docker-compose.yml`)

Restart the firmware.

## View logs remotely

The first thing we can do is view the MQTT broker's logs coming inside our log post-processor:

```sh

docker attach --no-stdin --sig-proxy=false supergreencloud_supergreenlog_1

```

You can safely `Ctrl+C` to exit that.

If nothing happens there might be something wrong, directly viewing the firmware's logs through usb will give hints.

## Graphs, Dashboards and monitoring

At that point we have:

```

firmware -> MQTT -> post-processor -> Prometheus

```

So we're ready to view our data as graphs.

Just point to the URL you specified in your `docker-compose.yml` with your browser, if you left the default, you'll have `grafana.supergreenlab.com`, DON'T FORGET TO ADD IT TO YOUR `/etc/hosts` OR THAT WON'T BE WHAT YOU THINK IT BE.

Default access are:

- login: `supergreen`
- password: `multipass`

Now everthing should be setup for you to start their tutorial from [this section](http://docs.grafana.org/guides/getting_started/#dashboards-panels-the-building-blocks-of-grafana).
