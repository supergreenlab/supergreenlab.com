            offered by us), without undue delay and in any

            unless you have expressly agreed otherwise;
            in any event, you will not incur any fees as a

          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Judge or Jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.

          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arbitrator and Rules.

These rules can be found on the AAA website at www.adr.org.</span></p>

          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To begin an arbitration proceeding, You must send Us a notice of dispute, in writing, setting forth Your name, address and contact information, the facts of the dispute and relief requested. You must send Your notice of legal dispute to Us at the following address: 1675 South State Street, Suite B, Dover, Delaware, 19901. SuperGreenLab will send any notice of dispute to You at the contact information We have for You.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Format of Proceedings.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fees. If You initiate arbitration, Your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the AAA&rsquo;s Consumer Arbitration Rules. Unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, each party shall pay its own AAA and arbitrator&rsquo;s fees and expenses. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then You agree to pay all costs and expenses connected to the arbitration.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual Basis.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, You and SuperGreenLab each agree that any dispute resolution proceeding will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, You and SuperGreenLab each waive any right to a jury trial. As a result, PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IN THIS EVENT, YOU AGREE THE SOLE PROPER FORUM AND VENUE IS A STATE COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED IN DOVER, DELAWARE.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitation Period.</span></p>

All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms of Service shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement by SuperGreenLab or You. Termination will not limit any of SuperGreenLab&rsquo;s other rights or remedies at law or in equity. Article 5.3, Indemnification and any other provision by its nature is intended to survive termination, does survive termination of this Agreement.</span></p>

It is expressly understood that in the event either party on any occasion fails to perform any term hereof and the other party does not enforce that term, the failure to enforce on any occasion will not constitute a waiver of any term and will not prevent enforcement on any other occasion. Nothing contained in these Terms of Service will be deemed to constitute either party as the agent or representative of the other party or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose. In the event that either party is prevented from performing, or is unable to perform, any of its obligations under these Terms of Service due to any cause beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this provision, the affected party&rsquo;s performance will be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform due to such occurrence. The headings and captions contained herein will not be considered to be part of the Terms of Service but are for convenience only.
