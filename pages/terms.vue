          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) If You believe that any of Your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) after We received a notice of copyright infringement is not actually infringing, or that You have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner&rsquo;s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use such content, You may send a counter-notice containing the following information to Our copyright agent: (1) Your physical or electronic signature (with Your full legal name); (2) identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled; (3) a statement that You have a good faith belief, under penalty of perjury, that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and (4) Your name, address, telephone number, and email address, and a statement that You will accept service of process from the person who provided the original notification of the alleged infringement.</span></p>

          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binding Arbitration.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Any dispute or claim arising in any way from Your use of the Website, App and Electronic devices, except for disputes relating to the infringement of Our intellectual property rights or the access or use of the Website, App and Electronic devices in violation of these Terms of Service, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Judge or Jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Service as a court would.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arbitrator and Rules. The arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single arbitrator, whose decision will be final and binding, and the arbitral proceedings shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer&not; Related Disputes. These rules can be found on the AAA website at www.adr.org.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting an Arbitration.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To begin an arbitration proceeding, You must send Us a notice of dispute, in writing, setting forth Your name, address and contact information, the facts of the dispute and relief requested. You must send Your notice of legal dispute to Us at the following address: 1675 South State Street, Suite B, Dover, Delaware, 19901. SuperGreenLab will send any notice of dispute to You at the contact information We have for You.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Format of Proceedings.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fees. If You initiate arbitration, Your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the AAA&rsquo;s Consumer Arbitration Rules. Unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, each party shall pay its own AAA and arbitrator&rsquo;s fees and expenses. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, then You agree to pay all costs and expenses connected to the arbitration.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual Basis.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, You and SuperGreenLab each agree that any dispute resolution proceeding will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, You and SuperGreenLab each waive any right to a jury trial. As a result, PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IN THIS EVENT, YOU AGREE THE SOLE PROPER FORUM AND VENUE IS A STATE COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED IN DOVER, DELAWARE.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitation Period.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by You or SuperGreenLab be instituted more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enforcement.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invalidity.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, or if you opt out as provided for in Section 6.11, You and SuperGreenLab each agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of a State court of competent jurisdiction located in Dover, Delaware, and You and SuperGreenLab each agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any applicable dispute or claim.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opting Out.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If You do not want to arbitrate disputes with SuperGreenLab and You are an individual, You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to Contact@supergreenlab.com within thirty (30) days of the first of the date You access or use the Website, App and Electronic devices.</span></p>

          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If You breach any of the terms of these Terms of Service, without regard to whether such breach is material or results in a material adverse effect, all licenses granted by Us, including permission to use the Website, App and Electronic devices, will terminate automatically. Your duty to indemnify Us survives any termination. Additionally, We may suspend, disable, or delete Your Account, the Website, App and Electronic devices (or any part of the foregoing) with or without notice, for any or no reason. If We delete Your Account for any suspected breach of these Terms of Service by You, You are prohibited from re-registering for the Website, App and Electronic devices under a different name. All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms of Service shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement by SuperGreenLab or You. Termination will not limit any of SuperGreenLab&rsquo;s other rights or remedies at law or in equity. Article 5.3, Indemnification and any other provision by its nature is intended to survive termination, does survive termination of this Agreement.</span></p>
          <p :class="$style.c2"><span :class="$style.c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Injunctive Relief. You agree that a breach of these Terms of Service will cause irreparable injury to SuperGreenLab for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and SuperGreenLab shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security or proof of damages.</span></p>

These Terms of Service will inure to the benefit of and will be binding upon each party&rsquo;s successors and assigns. These Terms of Service and the licenses granted hereunder may be assigned by SuperGreenLab but may not be assigned by You without the prior express written consent of SuperGreenLab. Any attempt by You to assign these Terms of Service without the written consent of SuperGreenLab shall be null and void. If any provision hereof is or becomes, at any time or for any reason, unenforceable or invalid, no other provision hereof will be affected thereby and the remaining provisions will continue with the same effect as if such unenforceable or invalid provisions will not have been inserted herein; provided that the ability of either party to obtain substantially the bargained-for performance of the other will not have thereby been impaired. It is expressly understood that in the event either party on any occasion fails to perform any term hereof and the other party does not enforce that term, the failure to enforce on any occasion will not constitute a waiver of any term and will not prevent enforcement on any other occasion. Nothing contained in these Terms of Service will be deemed to constitute either party as the agent or representative of the other party or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose. In the event that either party is prevented from performing, or is unable to perform, any of its obligations under these Terms of Service due to any cause beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this provision, the affected party&rsquo;s performance will be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform due to such occurrence. The headings and captions contained herein will not be considered to be part of the Terms of Service but are for convenience only.
